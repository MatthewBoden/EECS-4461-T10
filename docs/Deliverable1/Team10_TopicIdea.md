# Section 1: Phenomena of Interest

Our chosen phenomenon is centered around self-driving vehicles that use Artificial Intelligence and their interactions with other vehicles. These other vehicles can be self-driving (AI-to-AI) or human-operated (AI-to-Human, Human-to-AI). When considering the AI-to-AI example, these vehicles communicate with each other using Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSCR) when in range. This enables them to send data about road conditions, their surroundings, and different analytics which can be passed through a large chain of self-driving cars in range. 

In terms of how this relates to course material, there are a multitude of connections. Firstly, there is an ever-evolving co-construction going on between technological determinism and social determinism. Artificial Intelligence-powered vehicles have to abide by the many laws that pertain to vehicles, such as speeding limits, traffic lights, etc. Society influences the technological advancements in this sector, as it can influence the extent of their autonomy through conceived notions and beliefs. These are just a few examples of the interplay between technological advancements and societal impacts. 

Secondly, we can explain this phenomenon with the metaphor of the trophic structure. The primary producers are the autonomous car manufacturers; the ones who are creating the vehicles that allow for the sending of signals to other vehicles. The primary consumers are the individuals who purchase and use these vehicles. The secondary consumers are the people who review or critique the vehicles. The tertiary consumers are the ones who perform analysis of the impacts of these vehicles (traffic metrics, collisions, etc…). Lastly, the quaternary consumers are the organizations and governments that form legislation around these vehicles: what is and what isn't allowed.

Finally, although there are many other examples of how this phenomenon relates to the course concept, affordance theory can be used to examine the action possibilities taken by these autonomous AI agents and how they evolve in our normative vehicle systems. The potential for AI to make decisions is truly limitless and thus should be seen from the viewpoint of affordance theory to better understand it.
